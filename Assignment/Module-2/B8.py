#Does Python support switch or case statement in Python?
#If not what is the reason for the same?
#Ans:
"""
Unlike every other programming languages we have used before,
Python does not have a switch or case statement.
because of Unsatisfactory Proposals.Nobody has been to suggest 
an implementation that works well with Python's s.yntax and 
established coding style.
There have been many proposals,some of which you can see in
PEP 3103 -- A Switch/Case Statement.
Most Programming languages have switch/case because they dont
have proper mapping construct.you cannot map a value to a function,
that's why they have it.but in python,you can easily have a mapping 
table(dict) where a certain value maps to a certain function.
Python Fun are first class values,you can use the fun as the values 
of the dictonary get(key[default])method.
