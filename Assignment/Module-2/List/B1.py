#Ans==>
"""
List is a collection which is ordered and changeable.Allow duplicate
members.
like a tuple,a list is an ordered sequence of values, where each value 
is identified by an index.
The syntax for expressing literals of type list is similar to that used
for tuples;
the differnce is that we use square brackets rather than parentheses.
The empty list is written as [].
